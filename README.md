# Face-Recognisation-Age-Gender-
Age and Gender recognition:
This is project is based on face recognisation of the user and gives their gender and their precise age in python language.

How it works:

Age and Gender prediction in python leverages deep learning models,such as CNN's,trained on annotated image datasets.Facial features are analyzed,and patterns associated with different age groups and genders are identified.Preprocessing involves face detection and alignment.Evaluation metrices include accuracy and classification accuracy for gender prediction.When the code runs in terminal the camera will pop up,user face will be detected which gives his/her age and gender if the face is present infront of camera.

Future Directions:

Age and Gender prediction in python serves various practical applications including targeted marketing,perrsonlized user experiences,health care diagnotics and security surveillance,enabling tailored solutions and improved-making in diverse domains

Requirements:

Pre-trained Face,age and gender deteced files like proto.txt,caffeemodels files,.pbtxt file and detection_matrix
